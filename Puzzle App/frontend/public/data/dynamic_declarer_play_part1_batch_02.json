Win the second spade and concede a spade trick to South. In this way the communication between the defenders is broken. If South runs his winning spades North will have problems with discards. You discard two clubs from your hand and two diamonds and a club from the dummy. According to the cards North throws, you will know which squeeze to execute. You can play for any of three squeezes: a) heart-club squeeze against North, b) diamond-club squeeze against North, c) A double squeeze, diamond-club squeeze against North and diamond-heart squeeze against South.",
