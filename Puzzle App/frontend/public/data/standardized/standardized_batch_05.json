You may figure out about the spade distribution and play the right card; queen or the nine. A spade trick would be useful if hearts were 3-0. 4. A heart to the dummy. 5. The last spade ruffed. 6. A heart to the dummy. 7. A club to the ten. North will be end-played when he wins the first round of clubs. You would go down only when South holds both missing club honours and the ace of diamonds is with North.",

North wins with the queen and plays a club back (a spade or a diamond would give you the contract directly). 6.
