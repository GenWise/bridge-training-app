We play the ace of diamonds and ruff a diamond next we cash the ace of clubs and a club to the ten. Both minors can break 4-1 as long as four clubs are with South. By playing diamonds we shall pick up all the trumps. When South ruffs, you overruff in the West hand and cross to dummy, drawing the last trump.",
