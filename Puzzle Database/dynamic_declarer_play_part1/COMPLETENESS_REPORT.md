## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use
1. **Use the cleaned dataset:** `dynamic_declarer_play_part1_cleaned.json`
2. **Focus on puzzles 1-120:** These provide excellent coverage with high completion rates
3. **Include puzzles 36-50:** Useful for practice even without solutions

### For Future Improvement
1. **Re-extract pages 280-386:** Target the missing puzzle range 121-170
2. **Complete solution extraction:** Focus on puzzles 36-50 solution pages
3. **Quality verification:** Manually verify a sample of extracted data

### For Application Development
1. **Implement data validation:** Check for required fields before loading puzzles
2. **Graceful degradation:** Show available puzzles and mark incomplete ones
3. **User feedback system:** Allow users to report data quality issues
